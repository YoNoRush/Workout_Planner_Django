To use this application, you need to open it on visual studio code. From there you run the project by clicking the green arrow or by inputting "$ python manage.py runserver" in the terminal.
To use the application you need to first sign up, you create an account with a username, email and password. From there you'll be able to create a user profile with all of your physical information, such as your weight, height, age, gender, etc. You can even upload a profile picture.
After doing so, you have to log in to access your workout companion, where you'll find your information, your workout, how many calories you should be consuming (depending on your workout choice and other factors) and you can even update your account or sign out.
